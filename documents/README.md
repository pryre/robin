# Documentation
A listing of supporting documentation for the robin autopilot. This should probably be moved to the wiki, but for the time being...

To write:
 - Document what hardware will only work with external power
 - Write a listing of what outputs are what
 - Document methods for adding "Modules" to the codebase
 - Add in descriptions of estimator and controller methods
 - Make a listing about global data structs
 - Explain fix16, v3d, mat16, and qf16 (especially quaternion w,x,y,z -> a,b,c,d)
